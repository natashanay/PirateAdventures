# PirateAdventures
fun with pirates and learning basic CRUD operations!
I am using Python to create a basic pirate adventure game to explore and learn
one to many and many to many relationships in database models. I use HTML to display the information from the database. 
I am using Django as the framework. This copy is the functional copy where I can Create, read and update. I need to indcorporate 
a delete. I still want to merge this with another project i did called Pirates Attack which allows each pirate to wound other pirates.
I also want to add some CSS and javascript and some images. This is a work in progress.
